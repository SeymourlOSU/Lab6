It makes more sense when trying to represent point data that posses a quantitative feature to use 3D mapping in order to give a visual representation to that data but only on that point, and it makes more sense to use 2D maps when displaying data that only has one value for each geographic point.

For example, 3D maps like the one in this lab for noise polution complaints or other user submitted data like twitter posts, location checkins, etc. are better than a 2D counter part because it allows a visual representation of all those submission, rather than being forced to display it using representitive numbers or 2D features that would likely overlap if there was too much data in one area.

For 2D, a good example of when its better is with something like google maps for its road network. The map is only being used for transportation so the road only needs to be shown in 2D.

To summerize 2D is more useful for simple map use and 3D for visualizing complex data.
